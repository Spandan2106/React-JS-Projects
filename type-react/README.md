# Typescript + React App

> A simple and attractive single-page application built by Spandan.

This project is a beginner-friendly demonstration of a React application built with TypeScript. It features a clean, modern UI with dynamic elements, animations, and a focus on good development practices like semantic HTML and accessibility.

## Features

- **Built with React and TypeScript:** Leverages the power of React for building UIs and TypeScript for type safety.
- **Interactive UI:** Includes a toggle button that uses the `useState` hook to manage and display a message dynamically.
- **Modern Styling:** Styled with pure CSS, featuring a beautiful animated gradient background, a glass-morphism effect on the main container, and subtle animations on elements.
- **Accessibility:** Implements ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to make the interactive elements accessible to screen readers.
- **Semantic HTML:** Uses proper HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for a well-structured and meaningful document outline.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
