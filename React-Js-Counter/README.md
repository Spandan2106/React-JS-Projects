A simple and stylish counter application built with React that runs directly in the browser without requiring any build tools or a local server.

## ✨ Features

- **Stateful Component**: A React class component manages the counter's state.
- **Increment/Decrement**: Buttons to increase or decrease the count.
- **Modern Styling**: A clean, centered UI with custom CSS, hover effects, and a fade-in animation.
- **Zero-Build Setup**: Runs directly in the browser using CDN-hosted libraries.

## 🚀 How to Run

This project is designed for maximum simplicity. No installation or build steps are needed.

1.  Ensure you have the `index.html`, `index.js`, and `style.css` files in the same directory.
2.  Simply open the **`index.html`** file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application will load and run.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project demonstrates how to run a React application without a complex setup by leveraging CDNs and in-browser transpilation.

-   **HTML5**
-   **CSS3**: For all styling, layout, and animations.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**
-   **React**: Loaded via a CDN to manage the UI components and state.
-   **ReactDOM**: Loaded via a CDN to render the React components into the DOM.
-   **Babel Standalone**: Used for in-browser transpilation of JSX syntax into plain JavaScript that the browser can understand.

This approach is excellent for small projects, prototypes, and for learning React without the overhead of setting up a full development environment like Vite or Create React App.
