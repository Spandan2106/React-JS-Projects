# My React.js Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing a collection of various React.js projects! This repository serves as a portfolio and a playground for exploring different aspects of React, including component design, state management, routing, API integration, and more.

Each project within this repository is typically self-contained within its own directory, making it easy to navigate and run individual applications.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
